# ORDA - Data Visualisation Showcase

Research impact is a key strategic priority for the University and data sharing is an excellent route to create impact. In addition, the vast majority of research funders in the UK now expect data underlying funded research to be made available for scrutiny and reuse. We are committed to providing support and services to make this as easy as possible, and earlier this year we launched ORDA (Online Research Data), a free platform for all University of Sheffield research staff and students to share their datasets, code, presentations, posters, grey literature and other non-traditional research outputs.

One of the best ways to make sure that data you share is working for you is to create easy ways for other researchers to explore the datasets. We (Research Software Engineering, the University Library and CICS) are therefore developing a data visualisation showcase site (https://orda.shef.ac.uk/visualisations/) as part of ORDA.
